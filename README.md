# What does it do?
Creates a (customizable) colorcoded spreadsheet (.xlsx) that shows the ratings for each episode in each season for a specific TV show. 

# Instructions
1. Install required libraries using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Run main.py
3. Type in IMDb ID for the specific show you want
4. Have fun

# Reasoning
I created this because I saw a few TikToks where spreadsheets with TV show ratings was shown. I researched a bit and found that they most likely have been created manually thereby motivating me to create an automated one; both because it was fun and challenging since I've never worked with openpyxl before.

Have fun using it :)
