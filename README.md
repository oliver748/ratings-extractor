# What does it do?
Creates a spreadsheet (.xlsx) that shows the ratings for each episode in each season for a specific TV show.

2. Run main.py
3. Type in IMDb ID for the specific show you want
4. Have fun

# Info
At the moment the code isn't written well - at least according to me. I'll work on it to make it more readable and possibly faster.
